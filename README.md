# project_2

This project includes visualizations based upon North American concert data from 2015 to 2020. The data was sourced from published information generated by MTV and Pollstar. The visuals include information on what genres are represented in the top 200 North American tours as well as filterable visuals which indicate concert count by year and maps of popular tour stops among others.

This project includes a python flask powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL and Tableau. 

The website is run through GitHub pages and Python-Flask.
